# project_2_donovan
final product
This is a "choose your adventure" site.
The idea is pretty simple. Create content, replace with new content based on the choice.

There is an issue with the second iteration of choice.
A double click is required to move forward at that point.
It's a problem with the div not being loaded with the starting content.
